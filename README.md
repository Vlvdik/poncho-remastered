# New **async** bot for vk's conversations

##### The old project was lostðŸ˜¢
##### The source code of this furry friend was left on the old operating system, which I safely demolished

# Installation

### 1) Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vlvdik/poncho-remastered 
```
### 2) Create and configurate your config file (get API token, parse the necessary links etc)
```bash
touch config.py
```
#### or like this (this method is more welcome, guess why)
```bash
cat config.py
```
### 3) Run your app at a point server.py
```bash
python server.py
```
# Done!
